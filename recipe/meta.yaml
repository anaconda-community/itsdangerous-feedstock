  summary: Safely pass data to untrusted environments and back.
  description: |
        Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it
        back safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a
        token has not been tampered with.

        It's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as
        needed. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while
        loading a token.
